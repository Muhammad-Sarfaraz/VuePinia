# Vue Pinia

# Local Setup Instructions

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run local server with database
npm run dev
```

If you're having issues with running the json-server for the database, you will also want to run the following command to run the database server separately.

```sh
# Run database
npm run db
```
